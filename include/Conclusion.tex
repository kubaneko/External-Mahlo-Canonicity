\chapter{Conclusion}

Our contribution is the proof of canonicity of the external Mahlo universe. Previously most of the work on Mahlo universe was on justifying its consistency and determining its proof-theoretic strength \cite{setzer1996model, setzer2000extending, setzer2005universes} and building predicative semantics of Mahlo \cite{dybjer2023extended}.

We hope that this work will increase the understanding of metatheoretic properties for strong induction principles and eventually will lead to a normalization proof for Mahlo and proofs of metatheoretic properties of induction-recursion. One current problem with these is that there is currently no presheaf model for induction-recursion and in order to prove normalization of Mahlo by gluing one would be needed.
